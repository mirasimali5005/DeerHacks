🔥 24-Hour Roadmap for "AR Time Capsule" (4-Person Team)
✅ Goal: Build an MVP where users can drop & discover messages in AR using WebAR + Firebase.
✅ Learning Approach: Each member learns only what’s necessary to finish their task.

💡 Team Roles & Tasks
Team Member	Role	Primary Focus
Dev 1	Frontend (React)	UI for submitting/viewing messages
Dev 2	Backend (Firebase + Firestore)	Store & retrieve messages
Dev 3	AR Integration (AR.js + WebAR)	Display messages in AR
Dev 4	GPS & Location Services (Google Maps API)	Handle geolocation
⏳ Hour-by-Hour Breakdown
⏳ Hours 1-4: Learning (Focused & Split by Role)
💡 Everyone learns their assigned tech stack for the MVP.

Team Member	What to Learn?	Resources (Quickest Guides)
Dev 1 (Frontend - React)	Basics of React (Components, State, Hooks, Fetching Data)	React Crash Course (2 Hours)
Dev 2 (Backend - Firebase Firestore)	Setting up Firebase (Firestore, Firestore Queries, Authentication)	Firebase Firestore Basics (1 Hour)
Dev 3 (AR - AR.js / WebAR)	How to place objects in AR & interact with them	AR.js for Beginners (1 Hour)
Dev 4 (GPS & Location Services - Google Maps API)	How to get & use user’s live location	Google Maps API Basics (1 Hour)
🚀 By Hour 4: Everyone has a basic grasp of their area.

⏳ Hours 5-8: Setup & Connecting Parts
Task	Who Works on It?	Tools/Tech
1. Set up Firebase Project & Firestore DB	Dev 2	Firebase Console
2. Create a simple React frontend	Dev 1	React + TailwindCSS
3. Set up AR.js and test a simple AR object	Dev 3	AR.js (A-Frame)
4. Get user’s location & display on a map	Dev 4	Google Maps API
🚀 By Hour 8:
✅ Firebase database is set up & connected.
✅ Basic React frontend is working.
✅ AR.js shows an AR object.
✅ Google Maps displays user’s location.

⏳ Hours 9-15: Core MVP Development (Split Tasks)
💡 Each developer focuses on their feature, but they all work together to integrate everything.

Feature	Who Works on It?	Details
1. Drop Messages (Store Text + Location in Firebase)	Dev 2 & Dev 4	Saves lat/lon + message to Firestore
2. Fetch Nearby Messages	Dev 2 & Dev 4	Queries Firestore to find messages within 50m
3. Display Messages in AR	Dev 3 & Dev 1	When user is near a message, it appears in AR
4. UI for Users to Drop & Discover Messages	Dev 1 & Dev 3	Buttons for adding & viewing messages
🚀 By Hour 15:
✅ Messages can be stored & retrieved from Firebase.
✅ Messages appear when users walk near them.
✅ Basic AR rendering is working.

⏳ Hours 16-20: Debugging & UI Polishing
Task	Who Works on It?	Fixes Needed
1. Fix any database errors (message retrieval issues)	Dev 2	Optimize Firebase queries
2. Improve AR message placement	Dev 3	Ensure messages don’t overlap
3. Make UI more user-friendly	Dev 1	Adjust button placement & colors
4. Optimize GPS location detection	Dev 4	Reduce errors in lat/lon updates
🚀 By Hour 20:
✅ No major bugs.
✅ Messages show up accurately in AR.
✅ UI looks presentable.

⏳ Hours 21-24: Final Testing & Demo
✅ Test on multiple devices.
✅ Fix small UI issues & polish UX.
✅ Deploy MVP using Firebase Hosting.
✅ Prepare a short demo & slides.

🔥 Final MVP Deliverables
✅ Users can drop messages in AR (Text-based).
✅ Messages are stored in Firebase & retrieved when nearby.
✅ Basic UI to drop & view messages.
✅ Fully working MVP deployed on Firebase Hosting.

🚀 Final Verdict: Can You Learn & Build in 24 Hours?
✅ Yes! This roadmap is structured so each team member learns only what they need while working in parallel.
